# FizzBuzz (Hackerrank)
This is my Solution to the FizzBuzz Test, which i found at Hackerrank.


I deleted hackerrank testcases etc.

Given a number n, for each integer i in the range from 1 to n inclusive,
print one value per line as follows:
    If i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
    If i is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Fizz.
    If i is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Buzz.
    If i is not a multiple of 3Â or 5, print the value of i.
